                                    Teaching at EDA is as much about people as it is about technology. I was responsible for preparing and delivering lectures of technical content, supporting students as they worked through coding challenges, and checking in with them about how they were coping with the content and intensity of the course. I was also responsible for leading group mindfulness sessions every morning, and holding regular discussions related to human-focused topics such as diversity, self-talk, and the importance of feedback.

                                    Every ten weeks presented an entirely new set of humans with different strengths, personalities, backgrounds, and intentions. As a result, the role required immense adaptability in the way I delivered content and held the group throughout the course.

                                    I was primarily responsible for handling incoming support and enhancement requests for several major corporate clients. This work involved triage, estimations, and developing solutions as needed. The work was high-pace and high-impact as solutions often required deployment to live websites, including being available for on-call support. Success in this role was helped by my aptitude for problem-solving, and I am grateful for it helping advancing my knowledge of the domain.

                                    Later, I transitioned to the build team where I worked on both the back-end and front-end of several website rebuilds. I was then put forward for contracting roles and spent a year working on-site with clients for several months at a time as the lead front-end developer.
